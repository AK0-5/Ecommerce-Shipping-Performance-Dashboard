# E-Commerce Shipping Performance Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce shipping data to identify delivery delay patterns and evaluate their impact on customer satisfaction. The analysis combines **Python for data cleaning & EDA** and **Power BI for interactive dashboarding**.

The dashboard provides actionable insights into shipment modes, warehouse performance, product importance, discounts, and delivery outcomes.

## Business Problem
E-commerce businesses often face delayed deliveries without clear visibility into the root causes. This project aims to:
- Identify key drivers of delivery delays
- Evaluate operational inefficiencies
- Understand how delays affect customer ratings
- Support data-driven logistics decisions

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI**
- **CSV Dataset (Kaggle)**
- **GitHub**

## Key KPIs
- Total Orders
- Delayed Orders
- Average Rating
- Average Discount
- On-Time Delivery %

---

## Dashboard Insights
- Ship mode has the highest number of delayed deliveries
- Certain warehouses consistently underperform
- High product importance orders still experience delays
- Delayed deliveries result in lower customer ratings
- Most delivery delays occur in low-discount orders, mainly due to higher order volume in that category
